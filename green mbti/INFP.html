                     <p>INFPs have vibrant, passionate inner lives. Creative and imaginative, they happily lose themselves in daydreams, inventing stories and conversations in their minds. INFPs share a sincere curiosity about the depths of human nature. They yearn to understand the people around them despite being attuned to their own thoughts and feelings. INFPs have a talent for self-expression. They may reveal their innermost thoughts and secrets through metaphors and fictional characters. INFPs tend to feel stuck until they connect with a sense of purpose for their life. And for many, this purpose has something to do with uplifting others.</p>

               <p> Tolerant and accepting, INFPs try not to judge anyone else’s beliefs, lifestyles, or decisions. INFPs love to see things from unconventional perspectives. Few things give them more pleasure than allowing their mind to wander through all sorts of ideas, possibilities and daydreams.</p>

                   <p> INFPs long to connect with others, but they don’t always know how. They may sometimes feel lonely or isolated. INFPs believe in their unique potential, and they desperately want to live up to it. But this can cause them to have unrealistic expectations for themselves. </p>

                     <p>Romantic: For INFPs, an ideal relationship of any kind is one in which both people feel comfortable sharing not just their wildest hopes and dreams but also their secrets, fears, and vulnerabilities. INFPs use their compassion and insight to understand the people they care about, and they draw on their creativity to make their partner feel special.</p>

                    <p>Friendships: Among kindred spirits, INFPs feel accepted and understood, happy to be themselves and bloom in their own time. Even as their friendships grow stronger, INFPs’ enigmatic qualities never truly vanish.</p>
