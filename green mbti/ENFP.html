                     <p>ENFPs are true free spirits, outgoing, openhearted and open-minded. They are independent and creative, always on the lookout for the magic and meaning in everyday life. They can’t help but ponder the deeper significance of life, even when they should be paying attention to something else. ENFPs are capable of intense thought and feeling, and also kicking back and having a good time. They are proof that seeking out life’s joys and pleasures isn’t the same as being shallow. </p>

               <p> ENFPs may live for deep, meaningful conversations, but they can also be spontaneous and lighthearted. They know how to find fun and joy in the present moment and few things give them more pleasure than sharing their joy with others. When something captures their imagination and inspires them, ENFPs want to share it with anyone who will listen.</p>

                   <p> Most ENFPs are uncomfortable with the prospect of being disliked. When the fail to win someone over, they might lose sleep trying to figure out what to do about it. ENFPs’ positive and upbeat attitude makes them rarely seem upset or dissatisfied on the outside. But their inner idealism can leave them with a feeling that some major areas of their life aren’t good enough. </p>

                     <p>Romantic: For ENFPs, romantic relationships are beautiful and exhilirating, an opportunity for two souls to not only explore the world together but also connect on the deepest of levels. ENFPs know that lasting love takes effort and commitment but they may become alarmed when the work of being in a relationship starts to feel like “work”.</p>
               
                    <img src="img/friendship.png" alt="friend" class="icon" >
                    <p>Friendships: For ENFPs, friendship is an opportunity to see the universe through another person’s eyes. ENFPs can turn any occasion into an adventure, whether it be a dance party, an impromptu cookie-baking contest, or a soul-baring conversation about the state of the world. Even the idealists, ENFPs may find it difficult to accept that they can’t befriend everyone.</p>
