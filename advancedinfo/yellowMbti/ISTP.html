                     <p>ISTPs prefer to approach problems directly, seeking straightforward solutions over convoluted troubleshooting methods. They rely heavily on firsthand experience and trial and error as they execute their ideas and projects. ISTPs are direct but reserved, calm but suddenly spontaneous, industrious but focused on their own priorities, they can be a challenge to predict. ISTPs act spontaneously on a new interest, exploring its viability after they’ve shifted gears. ISTPs live freely on their own terms, valuing personal autonomy above most things.</p>

               <p>ISTPs are very imaginative when it comes to practical things, mechanics, crafts and skills. Novel ideas come easily to them and they love using their hands to put them into action. ISTPs are generally able to go with the flow and think on their feet. This flexibility comes with some unpredictability, but they are able to store their spontaneity for a rainy day, releasing their energy just when it’s needed most. </p>

                   <p>As easily as ISTPs go with the flow, they can also ignore it completely and move in another direction with little consideration for others’ preferences. ISTPs enjoy novelty, which makes them excellent thinkers, but they are much less reliable when it comes to focusing on things as novelty wanes.   </p>

                     <p>Romantic: ISTPs can be especially difficult to get to know in the early stages of a romantic relationship. ISTPs often leave things unsaid that they think are mutually understood. If ISTPs are to be lifelong partners, it must happen as a natural progression of day-to-day decisions made on their own time. </p>

                    <img src="gam/friendship.png" alt="friend" class="icon" >
                    <p>Friendships: ISTPs are thoughtful, rational people. Being fairly creative individuals themselves, they often enjoy putting a new spin on their interests with people who they feel close too. But in the end, the point of sharing those ideas needs to be to take action. ISTPs’ interesting hobbies and sharply pragmatic nature are attractive to a remarkably broad range of people.  </p>
