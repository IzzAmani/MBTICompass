                     <p>ESFPs get caught up in the excitement of the moment and want everyone else to feel that way too. ESFPs enjoy the simplest things, and there’s no greater joy for them than just having fun with a good group of friends. They would almost always choose to be with friends over spending time alone. There’s nothing that makes ESFPs feel quite as unhappy as realising that they are boxed in by circumstance, unable to join their friends. </p>

                         <img src="gam/bicep2.png" alt="Strengths icon" class="icon">

               <p> ESFPs aren’t known for holding back. Wanting to experience everything there is to experience, they don’t mind stepping out of their comfort zones when no one else is willing. ESFPs naturally exude the kind of positivity that lights up a room and draws people to them, and this often translates into an engaging charisma tat can inspire those around them. </p>

                   <p>ESFPs are strongly emotional and often vulnerable to criticism, they can feel like they’ve been backed into a corner, sometimes reacting badly. Anything that requires long-term dedication and focus is a particular challenge for ESFPs. ESFPs also rarely make detailed plans for the future.</p>

                     <p>Romantic: ESFPs are social, fun-loving, free-spirited individuals who live life in the moment and squeeze every little bit of excitement from everything. ESFPs tend to regard falling in love as the best part of a relationship. ESFPs happily chat about just about anything or anyone that comes to mind, but won’t have a topic forced.  ESFPs often respond poorly to outside “suggestions” on how to manage their love lives. ESFPs are incredibly likeable people who enjoy life’s small pleasures. </p>

                    <img src="gam/friendship.png" alt="friend" class="icon" >
                    <p>Friendships: ESFPs use an alluring combination of blunt truths, disarming openness, and charm to keep things moving. As ESFPs grow and mature, they come to respect different personality types and approaches more and more. To bring new people in, ESFPs extend an incredible sense of loyalty to their existing friends. </p>
