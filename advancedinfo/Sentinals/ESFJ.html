                     <p>ESFJs have a talent for making the people in their lives feel supported, cared for, and secure. ESFJ’s take their responsibility seriously to give back, serve others, and do the right thing. ESFJs have a clear moral compass and it can be nothing short of baffling to them when other people’s actions don’t align with it. ESFJs rarely miss a birthday or holiday. Devoted to their relationships, they commit even the smallest details of their friends’ and loved ones’ lives to memory. </p>

               <p>ESFJs are excellent managers of day-to-day tasks and routine maintenance, enjoying making sure that those who are close to them are well cared for. ESFJs naturally offer others the security and stability that they themselves want and need. They tend to seek out harmony and care deeply and care deeply about other people’s feelings, being careful not to offend or hurt others. </p>

                   <p>ESFJs sometimes try to establish their value with doting attention, something that quickly overwhelm those who don’t need it, making it ultimately unwelcome. It can be especially challenging to change the tendencies of being vulnerable to criticism because ESFJs are so conflict averse. They can become very defensive and hurt if someone, especially someone who’s close to them, criticises their habits, beliefs and traditions.  </p>

                    <img src="pic/romantic.png" alt="romantic icon" class="icon">
                     <p>Romantic: If they feel like the support that they crave isn’t there, such as when their partner delivers criticism, ESFJs can feel extremely hurt. They dislike conflict and criticism, which can make it challenging to address any problems that come up. ESFJs feel very at peace when they are involved in a secure, steady and loving relationship and have no problem with the dedication that monogamous relationships require.</p>

                    <img src="pic/friendship.png" alt="friend" class="icon" >
                    <p>Friendships: Highly sociable and energetic, ESFJs bring an upbeat, vibrant dynamic to their social engagements. They naturally thrive in environments where they are surrounded by lots of people. ESFJs have a tendency to believe that their friends can do no wrong, always stepping up to defend them regardless of circumstances, and they expect the same benefit of the doubt in return. </p>
