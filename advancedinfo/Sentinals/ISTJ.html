                     <p>True to their methodical nature, ISTJs often steer clear of impulsive behaviours, instead favouring careful deliberation when it comes to decision-making of any kind. ISTJs believe that there is a right way to proceed in any situation, and that anyone who pretends otherwise is probably trying to bend the rules to suit their own desires. ISTJs dedication is an admirable quality, and it drives many of their accomplishments. Due to this, ISTJs may often find themselves doing others’ work, and not getting credit for it. </p>

               <p>ISTJs would rather power through and lose sleep than fail to deliver the results that they said they would. They almost always fulfill their duties that they’ve committed themselves to, and they do so on time and with strict adherence to whatever guidelines were set in place. ISTJs are known to be organised and effective, so clear rules and regulations help them maintain order and work in a productive manner. </p>

                   <p> Since ISTJs tend to highly value facts and empirical evidence, they are unlikely to respect people who disagree with proven information especially those who remain willfully ignorant. ISTJs believe that things work best with clearly defined rules, but it makes them reluctant to bend those rules or try new things even when the downside’s minimal.  </p>

                     <p>Romantic: As their relationships transition into the long-term, ISTJs gladly see to the necessary daily tasks around the house, applying the same sense of duty to their home life that they do in the workplace. ISTJs embody a strong and quiet determinations and reliability. These traits are rare among other personality types.</p>

                    <p>Friendships: Navigating friendships, ISTJs display a sense of dedication, loyalty, and trustworthiness that make them reliable companions. ISTJs’ actions convey a sensitivity that many fail to see, but it is a quality that their friends come to admire and depend on in the long years of their friendships. </p>
