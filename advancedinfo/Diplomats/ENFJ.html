                     <p >ENFJs strive to have a positive impact on other people and the world around them. They rarely shy away from an opportunity to do the right thing, even when doing so is far from easy. ENFJs tend to be vocal about their values, including authenticity and altruism. They speak up when something strikes them as unjust or wrong, but rarely come across as brash or pushy. ENFJs are genuine, caring people who talk the talk and walk the walk. Nothing makes them happier than motivating others to do what’s right.</p>

               <p> Determined and inspiring, ENFJs often find their way into leadership roles. They excel at engaging in conversation, captivating people’s attention and rallying people together behind a common goal. ENFJs brim with interests, and they take great pleasure in pursuing their hobbies.</p>

                   <p>ENFJs have a tendency to take on other people’s problems as their own. This habit can leave them emotionally and physically exhausted. Many ENFJs put pressure on themselves to correct every wrong that they encounter. But no matter how hard they try, it just isn’t realistic for them to solve all of the world’s problems.</p>

                     <p>Romantic: Once ENFJs know who they want to be with, they will move mountains in pursuit of the one they love. For an ENFJ, one of life’s greatest joys is helping someone they care about reach their goals. </p>
               
                    <img src="img/friendship.png" alt="friend" class="icon" >
                    <p>Friendships: ENFJ’s passion for altruism often leads them to extend their circle of influence beyond their immediate group, offering assistance to others within their network and creating opportunities where none existed. From their closest friends to their wide circle of friends, ENFJs approach relationships with a sense of purpose, creating bonds that are not easily broken. As they mature, many ENFJs learn to avoid taking their friends’ behavior personally.</p>
