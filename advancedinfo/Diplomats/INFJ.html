                     <p>INFJs aren’t content to coast through life, they want to stand up and make a change. For them, success doesn’t come from money or status but from seeking fulfillment, helping others, and being a force for good in the world. They care about integrity and they are rarely satisfied until they’ve done what they know to be right. They move through life with a clear sense of their values and they aim to never lose sight of what truly matters, not according to people or society at large but according to their own wisdom and intuition. INFJs value deep, authentic relationships with others. They enjoy meaningful conversations far more than small talk. For INFJs, one of the most rewarding aspects of life is seeking out a purpose. And once they’ve found it, they strive to do it justice. </p>
