                     <p>ISFPs embrace a flexible, adaptable approach to life. They prefer to take each day as it comes, doing what feels right to them in the moment. ISFPs want to live in a world where they and everyone else have the freedom to live as they see fit without judgement. ISFPs sometimes have a pretty cloudy view of their ability to achieve their goals and they often worry about letting other people down. ISFPs are warm, friendly and caring, taking wholehearted enjoyment in the company of their nearest and dearest.</p>

               <p>ISFPs easily relate to others’ emotions, helping them establish harmony and goodwill and minimise conflict. Many ISFPs are even able to perceive others’ emotions just by listening to their voices. ISFPs possess an innate kindness and fairness that fuels their understanding and empathy toward others and often helps them to create a safe space for others to express their thoughts and feelings. </p>

                   <p>ISFPs dislike long-term commitments and plans. The tendency to actively avoid planning for the future can cause strain in their romantic relationships and financial hardship later in life. ISFPs live in the present, full of emotion. When situations get out of control, they can shut down, losing their characteristic charm and creativity in favor of gnashing teeth.  </p>

                     <p>Romantic: Things are unlikely to ever grow stale, even the longest-term partner can be surprised by random acts of love and devotion that ISFPs never grow tired of giving. ISFPs truly appreciate depth and meaningful connections. Consequently, as they grow to know their partner better and better, their level of attraction tends to intensify quite dramatically. ISFPs are not to be forced into anything, and rushing long-term commitments is a sure way to scare them off.</p>

                    <img src="gam/friendship.png" alt="friend" class="icon" >
                    <p>Friendships: When ISFPs are with friends they trust, they know how to relax, shedding rules, traditions, and expectations in favor of just enjoying themselves. Being friends with ISFPs means signing up for a bond that is marked by understanding, empathy, adaptability, and a shared love for exploration. </p>
