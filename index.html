                        Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is one of many ways to generalize one's personality. However, MBTI tackles the problem of
                        engagement in a special way; by making a bit size quiz that alot of people; mainly young children
                        or teenagers can absord easily!

                            The compatibility checker are more like guidelines rather than a strict rule book :)
